Start the FastAPI Mock Application from the SUT directory.

```bash
cd sut/FastAPIMockApp
```

Activate the virtual environment if needed.

```bash
source ../../.venv/bin/activate
```

Start the application.

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app \
    --host 127.0.0.1 \
    --port 8080
```

The application will be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

---

## Running Tests

All tests

```bash
pytest
```

Verbose output

```bash
pytest -v
```

Collect tests only

```bash
pytest --collect-only
```

---

## Smoke Tests

```bash
pytest -m smoke
```

---

## Regression Tests

```bash
pytest -m regression
```

---

## UI Tests

```bash
pytest -m ui
```

---

## API Tests

```bash
pytest -m api
```

---

## Authentication Tests

```bash
pytest -m auth
```

---

## Slow Tests

```bash
pytest -m slow
```

---

## Combined Marker Examples

Smoke UI tests

```bash
pytest -m "smoke and ui"
```

Regression UI tests

```bash
pytest -m "regression and ui"
```

Exclude slow tests

```bash
pytest -m "not slow"
```

Run smoke tests against a specific environment

```bash
pytest \
    -m smoke \
    --env=dev \
    --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

---

## Parallel Execution

The framework supports parallel execution using **pytest-xdist**.

Recommended:

```bash
pytest \
    -n 2 \
    --dist loadscope
```

This configuration keeps related tests together while improving execution time.

Current recommendation:

* ✅ `-n 2`
* ✅ `--dist loadscope`

Avoid:

```bash
pytest -n auto
```

for tests that share mutable backend state, as this can introduce race conditions.

---

## Test Markers

The framework organizes tests using pytest markers.

| Marker     | Purpose               |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| smoke      | Critical smoke tests  |
| regression | Full regression suite |
| ui         | Browser automation    |
| api        | API automation        |
| auth       | Authentication tests  |
| slow       | Long-running tests    |

Examples:

Run smoke UI tests

```bash
pytest -m "smoke and ui"
```

Run API regression tests

```bash
pytest -m "api and regression"
```

Exclude slow tests

```bash
pytest -m "not slow"
```

---

## Test Reports

The framework supports multiple reporting formats.

## HTML Report

```bash
pytest \
    --html=test-results/report.html \
    --self-contained-html
```

---

## JUnit XML

```bash
pytest \
    --junitxml=test-results/junit-results.xml
```

---

## Generate Both Reports

```bash
pytest \
    --html=test-results/report.html \
    --self-contained-html \
    --junitxml=test-results/junit-results.xml
```

Generated output:

```text
test-results/
├── report.html
└── junit-results.xml
```

These reports are automatically generated during GitHub Actions CI runs and can also be produced locally.

---

## Failure Diagnostics

The framework captures useful diagnostic information when tests fail.

Current capabilities include:

* Structured logging
* HTML reports
* JUnit XML
* Browser screenshots *(where applicable)*
* Playwright trace support *(future enhancement)*

The goal is to simplify debugging while providing actionable failure information during both local development and CI execution.


## FastAPI Mock Application (System Under Test)

## Overview

The Playwright Enterprise Test Framework includes a realistic FastAPI-based System Under Test (SUT).

Rather than relying on public demo websites, the framework uses its own web application to provide stable, repeatable, and deterministic browser automation.

The FastAPI Mock Application is maintained as a Git submodule, allowing the automation framework and application under test to evolve independently while remaining tightly integrated.

Repository location:

```text
sut/
└── FastAPIMockApp/
```

---

## Purpose

The SUT provides a realistic enterprise web application for validating:

* User authentication
* Browser automation
* Device management workflows
* CRUD operations
* API testing
* Accessibility
* Stable automation selectors

This approach allows the Playwright framework to simulate enterprise QA workflows without depending on external services.

---

## Current Features

### Authentication

* Login page
* Username/password authentication
* Authentication validation
* Invalid login handling

### Device Management

* View device list
* Create devices
* Edit devices
* Delete devices

### API Endpoints

* Login
* Device CRUD operations
* Validation
* Error handling

### Accessibility

The UI includes accessibility improvements designed for both end users and automated testing.

Examples include:

* Proper `<label>` elements
* Accessible form controls
* ARIA roles
* Status messages
* Alert messages

---

## Stable Automation Selectors

The application exposes dedicated automation selectors using `data-testid`.

Examples include:

```text
create-device-name
create-device-status
create-device-submit

device-row-1

edit-device-1
delete-device-1

edit-device-name
edit-device-status
edit-device-save

operation-success
```

These selectors provide stable browser automation that is resistant to UI layout changes.

---

## Playwright Page Object Model

The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

Current page objects include:

```text
ui_tests/
└── pages/
    ├── base_page.py
    ├── login_page.py
    └── devices_page.py
```

Responsibilities:

## BasePage

Provides reusable browser operations:

* Navigation
* Clicking
* Filling inputs
* Waiting
* Assertions

---

## LoginPage

Encapsulates authentication workflows.

Examples:

* Open login page
* Enter credentials
* Submit login
* Verify login

---

## DevicesPage

Encapsulates device management operations.

Examples:

* Open device page
* Create device
* Edit device
* Delete device
* Verify success messages
* Verify device visibility
* Verify device removal

Browser tests interact only with page objects rather than directly with Playwright locators.

---

## Docker Support

The framework supports execution inside Docker containers.

## Final Notes

The Playwright Enterprise Test Framework demonstrates how modern enterprise browser automation can be organized using clean architecture, reusable page objects, realistic system-under-test design, and automated CI/CD workflows.

The project intentionally emphasizes engineering best practices over test quantity. By combining browser automation, API testing, a realistic FastAPI Mock Application, Docker, GitHub Actions, and scalable project organization, it provides a practical foundation for enterprise-quality automation development.

As the framework evolves beyond v1.0, future work will focus on Kubernetes-based execution, expanded browser coverage, advanced automation capabilities, and cloud-native testing while preserving the maintainability and extensibility established in this initial release.
