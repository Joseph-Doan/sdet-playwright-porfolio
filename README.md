# sdet-playwright-porfolio
A comprehensive SDET portfolio focused on quality engineering at scale. Demonstrates Playwright (Python) automation frameworks, API testing, CI/CD pipelines, containerized execution with Docker, Kubernetes-based test orchestration, and real-world test strategy and architecture decisions.

👋 Overview
This repository is a Mid–Senior SDET portfolio focused on quality engineering at scale.
It demonstrates how I design, build, and operate production-ready test automation systems using Playwright with Python, modern CI/CD practices, and cloud-native execution.

Rather than showcasing isolated test scripts, this portfolio emphasizes:
-  Test framework architecture
-  Automation strategy and trade-offs
-  Reliability, scalability, and maintainability
-  Integration with real-world delivery pipelines
The goal is to show how quality is engineered, not just tested.

🎯 What This Portfolio Demonstrates
This portfolio covers the full SDET responsibility spectrum:
- UI Automation using Playwright (Python) with a maintainable framework design
- API Automation focusing on fast, stable feedback below the UI layer
- CI/CD Integration with automated execution on pull requests and merges
- Containerized Test Execution using Docker for environment consistency
- Kubernetes-Based Test Orchestration for scalable and parallel execution
- Quality Engineering Documentation including test strategy, risk-based testing, and automation ROI
Each project is designed to reflect patterns used in real engineering teams.

🧠 SDET Philosophy
I view the SDET role as an engineering function that enables teams to ship with confidence.
Quality is not defined by the number of tests written, but by:
- The speed and reliability of feedback
- The trustworthiness of automation
- The reduction of production risk
Automation exists to protect critical user and business flows, integrate seamlessly into CI/CD, and scale as systems grow.
Flaky or low-signal tests are treated as system problems, not acceptable trade-offs.

🧰 Technology Stack
- Language: Python
- UI & API Automation: Playwright
- Test Runner: pytest
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerization: Docker
- Test Orchestration: Kubernetes
Tooling choices are driven by stability, observability, and scalability, not popularity.
